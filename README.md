# Electron-React-Bootstrap-Structure

This is a basic structure for an Electron application built with React and Bootstrap. The project is designed to demonstrate a clear and organized directory structure for developing an Electron app with modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

The `Electron-React-Bootstrap-Structure` project is built using Node.js v22.5.1 and includes the following technologies:
- **Electron**: For building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies.
- **React**: For creating a dynamic and modular frontend.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive and modern UI components.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:
```
electron-react-app-structure
├── src
│ ├── main
│ │ ├── main.js # Entry point for the main process of Electron
│ │ ├── preload.js # Preload script to expose specific APIs to the renderer process
│ │ ├── mainWindow.js # Configuration and creation of the main window
│ │ └── ipcHandlers.js # Handles Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between main and renderer processes
│ ├── renderer
│ │ ├── assets
│ │ │ ├── css # CSS files for styling components
│ │ │ └── images # Image assets used in the application
│ │ ├── components
│ │ │ ├── App.js # Root component of the React application
│ │ │ ├── Header.js # Header component for the application layout
│ │ │ ├── Footer.js # Footer component for the application layout
│ │ │ └── Sidebar.js # Sidebar component for additional navigation or content
│ │ ├── hooks
│ │ │ └── useAuth.js # Custom React hook for authentication logic
│ │ ├── services
│ │ │ ├── apiService.js # Service for handling API requests
│ │ │ └── userService.js # Service for user-related operations
│ │ ├── utils
│ │ │ └── formatDate.js # Utility function for formatting dates
│ │ ├── pages
│ │ │ ├── HomePage.js # Page component for the home page
│ │ │ └── SettingsPage.js# Page component for the settings page
│ │ ├── state # Directory for state management logic (e.g., Redux)
│ │ │ ├── actions.js # Redux action creators
│ │ │ ├── reducers.js # Redux reducers for updating state
│ │ │ └── store.js # Redux store configuration
│ │ └── index.js # Entry point for the renderer process
│ └── shared
│ ├── constants.js # Shared constants used across the application
│ ├── utils.js # Shared utility functions used across the application
│ └── config.js # Configuration settings for the application
├── public
│ └── index.html # Main HTML file for the renderer process
├── build # Directory where the production build files are output
├── config
│ ├── webpack.common.js # Common Webpack configuration shared between development and production
│ ├── webpack.dev.js # Webpack configuration for development environment
│ └── webpack.prod.js # Webpack configuration for production environment
├── package.json # Project metadata and dependency management
├── webpack.config.js # Main Webpack configuration file
├── .babelrc # Babel configuration file
└── docs
├── README.md # Project overview and instructions
└── architecture.md # Detailed architectural overview and benefits of the directory structure
```

## Benefits of This Directory Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The structure clearly separates the main process (`src/main`) from the renderer process (`src/renderer`). This separation helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

2. **Modularity**: By organizing React components, hooks, services, and utilities into distinct directories within `src/renderer`, the project promotes modularity and reusability.

3. **Scalability**: The structure supports scaling by allowing easy addition of new features and components without cluttering the project.

4. **Maintainability**: Shared constants and utility functions are kept in the `src/shared` directory, making them easily accessible and maintainable.

5. **State Management**: A dedicated `state` directory within `src/renderer` ensures that state management logic (such as Redux) is well-organized and manageable.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sheraz-Maqsood/Electron-React-Bootstrap-Structure.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Electron-React-Bootstrap-Structure
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the frontend using Babel:
    ```bash
    npm run
    ```

5. Start the Electron application:
    ```bash
    npm run electron
    ```

6. Create a distribution build:
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
